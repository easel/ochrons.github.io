Great libraries make programming so much easier. With Scala.js you can use both Scala and JavaScript libraries in your code easily.

Check out the community provided [JavaScript facades](facades.html) and ported [Scala libraries](libs.html).

To get your project quickly bootstrapped, use one of the Scala.js [project skeletons](skeletons.html) as a basis.
